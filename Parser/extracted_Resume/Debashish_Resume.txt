Resume: Debashish Roy LinkedIn Github Blog  Education  Email: debashish.roy@students.iiit.ac.in Mobile : +91-9179013596/7000992323  • International Institute of Information Technology Master of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering  • Jabalpur Engineering College  Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology; GPA: 8.12/10.0  Hyderabad, India Aug. 2021 – 2023 (Expected)  Jabalpur, India Aug. 2016 – July. 2020  Experience  • Google Summer of Code at NRNB  Software Engineer Intern  ◦ Plugin Loader System: Modiﬁed existing plugins which are used to work in old architecture to the new  architecture, such that they will be independent of libRoadRunner(host).  ◦ Simpliﬁed development of New Plugins: With the new system, users can develop C++ plugins without  considering rebuilding the whole system, which is not the case in the earlier version.  • Google Summer of Code at NRNB  Software Engineer Intern  May 2019 - Aug 2019 ◦ Integration of LibRoadRunner and RRPlugins: Integrate RRPlugin and Libroadrunner, also worked on the  idea of using diﬀerential evolution optimizer for Libroadrunner to speed up the optimization process.  ◦ Decreased Build Time: Decreased build time as well as conﬁguration time by integrating both the packages in  C++. It accelerated build time by 25%. It eases the overall build process and increases the throughput.  June 2020 - Aug 2020  Achievements  • JEST (Joint Entrance Screening Test): Achieved AIR 70 in JEST 2020 Theoretical Computer Science. • ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest: Selected for the ACM ICPC Regional, Amritapuri. • CodeChef : Secured rank 164 out of 12343 participants in Codechef challenge organized globally, 5-star rating. • Google Code Jam and Facebook Hackercup: Cleared Google Code Jam round and Facebook Hacker cup contest. • Merit Certiﬁcate by the CBSE and Government of India: Merit Certiﬁcate by CBSE for special achievement in  the 10th Board examination and Ministry of communication and IT Govt. of India.  • KVS National Chess Competition: Selected for the KVS Chess National Competition in 2015 and 2016. Projects • Chess Engine: AI-based chess program to play chess using C++ based on exploring the states and alpha-beta pruning. • Introsort: Sorting a large amount of data using C++ by the Introsort (Hybrid Algorithm), combination of Sedgewick’s quick sort, heap sort & insertion sort are based on the depth of the call stack. C++ sort() uses the same algorithm. • Desktop Assistant: It can perform an online search, play video & audio, tell time, open editor, extract information about search keywords from Wikipedia, etc., using Python and speech recognition library based on voice commands.  Programming Skills • Technical Skills: C++, C, Python, Bash, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. • Software & Environment: CMake, SWIG, Git, Linux(Debian) Distribution, Windows. Special Courses • AI Search Methods for Problem Solving: Some of the key insights are DFID, State Space Search, Heuristic Search:  Best First Search, Hill Climbing, Population-Based Search: Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization. Game Playing: Algorithms Minimax (NPTEL 12 week program).  Contribution and Leadership • Contest, So you think you can Code: Organized competitive programming contest in the college. It introduces 300+ students to the world of competitive coding. Took initiative and advocated for the culture of open source and competitive programming.  Interests  • Problem Solving (Codechef, Codeforces, Leetcode), Open Source, AI Search Methods for Problem Solving.  \x0c
